## Design & Inspiration

Limitations:

* 64x64 Resolution
* "Peaceful" Theme (and partially "The Main Mission Is A Sidequest" theme since your quest is so mundane)
* Attempts to use the palette: https://lospec.com/palette-list/eroge-48 for https://itch.io/jam/lospec-jam-3
* Made in the evenings over the course of ~14 days

Hopefully it is obvious what [game](https://www.nomanssky.com/) this is inspired by.
